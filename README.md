# crappy-cuckoo-installer
It's all in the name. Essentially a brainless script to install the prerequisites for cuckoo sandbox and get things kind of setup before you have to change the configuration options for cuckoo. This is still in development and eventually I would like to get it to where it get's everything setup and you just have to point it at your guest OS isos...

I claim no responsibility if this breaks your things. It literally says "crappy" in the name.

I'll add more documentation as this gets better or something.

Also, you can either run it as root or comment out the system check and just sudo. All commands are put in the sudo form if you choose to do that small edit. I don't because #lazy

Also also, I didn't develop the awsome Cuckoo Sandbox, but you can find out more about their awesomeness by going here:
http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/about.html

This script also uses VM Cloak to help in the creation of VM's. VM Cloak and their awesomeness of development and wonderful things can be found here:

I take zero and negative credit if possible for the amazing work that the developers for Cuckoo Sandbox and VMCloak did on their respective projects.
